Info
====

Since I have a lot of work now I have no more time for AB programming. During this time you (AB users) could help other users to solve thier problems reported in the Issues tab. I will also try to do my best.



AwesomeBump 4.0 Beta
====================

AwesomeBump is a free and open source program written using Qt library designed to generate normal, height, specular or ambient occlusion, metallic, roughness textures from a single image. Additional features like material textures or grunge maps are available. Since the image processing is done in 99% on GPU the program runs very fast and all the parameters can be changed in real time. AB was made to be a new alternative to known gimp plugin called Insane Bump or commercial tool: Crazy Bump.

Feel free to contact me if you find any bugs and problems: <awesomebump.help@gmail.com>

If you want to fix or improve something, please fork my repository and send me the pull-request with changes.

AB is using tinyobjloader for loading the OBJ files: https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader

Cube maps textures were taken from Humus page [link](http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Textures)

Installation
============

Since version 3.0
-----------------

Steps are almost the same as for earlier versions.
See the [pdf ](https://github.com/kmkolasinski/AwesomeBump/releases/download/BuildingAB/BuildingInstruction.pdf) for instructions.



For versions older than 3.0
---------------------------

1. Video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-WgHserrS0
2. In order to build AwesomeBump you will need to have qt-sdk installed: http://www.qt.io/download/
3. Download the sourcecode of AB from github and unzip it. Run Qt then open a new project using the AwesomeBump.pro file (located in AB source code folder.).
4. Setup the build path and run path (in project build settings panel) and compile the project (remember that your graphics card has to support at least openGL 4.0). Compilation step will take some time. Run the program. In case of problems see the `log.txt` file.
5. I hope you will like it :)

Command-line instructions
-------------------------

1. Open terminal and unzip or untar downloaded source code.

2. Enter to created folder

3. Open linuxBuildScript.sh file and set the propper Qt5 path. Save and close.

4. Run script with command: sh linuxBuildScript.sh

5. If everything gone well AB should start after compilation process. See Bin/ folder. There should be an AwesomeBump file now.

### OpenGL 3.30 support

You can now build AB to run all openGL instructions with 3.30 compatibility (note that tessellation will not work with 3.30). See [PDF ](https://github.com/kmkolasinski/AwesomeBump/releases/download/BuildingAB/BuildingInstruction.pdf) file and "Step 8" for more datails. Basically you just have to add `CONFIG+=release_gl330` command in the qmake settings in order to build 3.30-supported version of AwesomeBump.
